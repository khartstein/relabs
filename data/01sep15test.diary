----- ! PTB - ERROR: SYNCHRONIZATION FAILURE ! ----

One or more internal checks (see Warnings above) indicate that synchronization
of Psychtoolbox to the vertical retrace (VBL) is not working on your setup.

This will seriously impair proper stimulus presentation and stimulus presentation timing!
Please read 'help SyncTrouble' for information about how to solve or work-around the problem.
You can force Psychtoolbox to continue, despite the severe problems, by adding the command
Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1); at the top of your script, if you really know what you are doing.

One or more internal checks (see Warnings above) indicate that synchronization
of Psychtoolbox to the vertical retrace (VBL) is not working on your setup.

This will seriously impair proper stimulus presentation and stimulus presentation timing!
Please read 'help SyncTrouble' for information about how to solve or work-around the problem.
You can force Psychtoolbox to continue, despite the severe problems, by adding the command
Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1); at the top of your script, if you really know what you are doing.

----- ! PTB - ERROR: SYNCHRONIZATION FAILURE ! ----

One or more internal checks (see Warnings above) indicate that synchronization
of Psychtoolbox to the vertical retrace (VBL) is not working on your setup.

This will seriously impair proper stimulus presentation and stimulus presentation timing!
Please read 'help SyncTrouble' for information about how to solve or work-around the problem.
You can force Psychtoolbox to continue, despite the severe problems, by adding the command
Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1); at the top of your script, if you really know what you are doing.

----- ! PTB - ERROR: SYNCHRONIZATION FAILURE ! ----

One or more internal checks (see Warnings above) indicate that synchronization
of Psychtoolbox to the vertical retrace (VBL) is not working on your setup.

This will seriously impair proper stimulus presentation and stimulus presentation timing!

  <strong>PTB.Show/Sequence</strong>
  
  Description:	show a sequence of stimuli
  
  Syntax:	[tStart,tEnd,tShow,bAbort,x1,...,xN] = shw.<strong>Sequence</strong>(cX,tShow,<options>)
  
  In:
 	cX		- a cell of stimuli to show.  each element can be:
 				h:			the handle to a texture to show
 				str:		a string input to shw.Text
 				f:			the handle to a function that accepts an option
 							named 'window' that specifies a texture handle and
 							draws its stimulus onto that texture (e.g.
 							f('window',hT)).
 				{h,...}:	the handle to a texture along with other inputs to
 							shw.Texture
 				{strF,...}:	inputs to shw.(strF), (i.e. {'Circle','red',1}
 							executes shw.Circle('red',1))
 				{f,...}:	the handle to a function along with its inputs. the
 							function must accept an option argument 'window' that
 							specifies a texture handle and draw its stimulus onto
 							that texture (e.g. f(...,'window',hT)).
 	tShow	- a time specifying when to move on to the next stimulus, or the
 			  handle to a function that takes the current time as input and
 			  returns two booleans: the first indicates whether to abort the
 			  sequence and the second whether to move on to the next stimulus in
 			  the sequence. can also be an array/cell of times or function
 			  handles, one for each step in the sequence.  the input times
 			  depend on the tbase option.
 	<options>:
 		window:			('main') the name of the window on which to show the
 						sequence
 		tunit:			(<auto>) the unit of time.  can either be 'ms' for
 						PTB.Now time or 'tr' for the TR number. defaults based
 						on context:
 							fmri: tr
 							eeg/pyschophysics: ms
 		tbase:			('step') either 'step', 'sequence', or 'absolute' to
 						specify whether times are relative to the start of the
 						current step, the start of the sequence, or are absolute
 		prerender:		(false) true to prerender each stimulus as a texture
 						before starting the sequence.  this will take more time
 						up front and memory but reduce the amount of time it
 						takes to draw each stimulus during the sequence. note
 						that prerendering doesn't work if a stimulus depends on
 						the time arguments to render correctly.
 		postrelease:	(false) true to release textures only after the sequence
 						ends.   this will take more time after the sequence is
 						over and memory but reduce the amount of time it takes to
 						prepare each stimulus during the sequence.
 		xnow:			(<nothing>) a stimulus to show immediately, before the
 						sequence is prepared (see cX for syntax)
 		tstart:			(<immediate>) the absolute time at which to start the
 						sequence, or the handle to a function that takes the
 						current time as input and returns two booleans: the first
 						indicates whether to abort the sequence and the second
 						whether to start the sequence
 		fwait:			(<PTB.Scheduler.Wait>) a handle or cell of handles the
 						same size as cX to functions that take the current time
 						and the time of the next stimulus presentation (or NaN
 						where tShow is a function handle) as input and return at
 						least a boolean as the first output that indicates
 						whether the sequence should be aborted, and are executed
 						while the sequence is waiting to move on to the next
 						stimulus. non-empty return values beyond the first output
 						are appended to the output arguments x1 ... xN. if a cell
 						of function handles is passed then each function must
 						return the same number of outputs.  set this to false to
 						do nothing but wait 1ms.
 		max_wait:		(10) the desired maximum execution time for calls to
 						PTB.Scheduler.Wait, in ms.  this only applies where
 						functions rather than times were specified in tShow.
 		wait_priority:	(PTB.Scheduler.PRIORITY_LOW) only execute scheduler tasks
 						at or above this priority while waiting to move on to the
 						next step in the sequence  only applies if the default
 						fwait function is used.
 		fixation:		(true) true to show the fixation dot on each stimulus
 		fixation_task:	(false) true to show the fixation task.  can also be a
 						logical array the same size as the sequence indicating
 						whether the fixation_task should be shown for each
 						stimulus.
  
  Out:
 	tStart				- the time at which the sequence started
 	tEnd				- the time at which the sequence aborted or ended
 	tShow				- the actual time at which each stimulus appeared on the
 						  screen
 	bAbort				- true if the sequence was aborted
 	xK					- a cell of all the non-empty (K+1)th outputs from the
 						  wait functions
  
  Example:
 	%show four strings spaced every one second 
 	cX	= {'this','is','a','test'};
 	shw.<strong>Sequence</strong>(cX,1000,'tunit','ms');
 	
 	%show three textures interspersed with a blank.  the subject must press
 	%the space bar to advance after each stimulus
 	cX		= {hTBlank hT1 hTBlank hT2 hTBlank hT3 hTBlank};
 	fShow	= @(t) deal(false,ptb.Input.DownOnce('key_space'));
 	tShow	= {1000 fShow 1000 fShow 1000 fShow 1000};
 	shw.<strong>Sequence</strong>(cX,tShow);

INFO: PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO: a total of 3 times out of a total of 10 flips during this session.

INFO: This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO: if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO: If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
INFO: of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least
INFO: deserve your closer attention. Cfe. 'help SyncTrouble', the FAQ section at www.psychtoolbox.org and the
INFO: examples in the PDF presentation in PsychDocumentation/Psychtoolbox3-Slides.pdf for more info and timing tips.

INFO: PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO: a total of 3 times out of a total of 6 flips during this session.

INFO: This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO: if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO: If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
INFO: of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least
INFO: deserve your closer attention. Cfe. 'help SyncTrouble', the FAQ section at www.psychtoolbox.org and the
INFO: examples in the PDF presentation in PsychDocumentation/Psychtoolbox3-Slides.pdf for more info and timing tips.

PTB-INFO: Connected to NVidia GK107M [GeForce GT 650M Mac Edition] GPU of NV-0e0 family with 4 display heads. Beamposition timestamping enabled.
PTB-INFO: Many graphics cards do not support proper timing and timestamping of visual stimulus onset
PTB-INFO: when running in windowed mode (non-fullscreen). If PTB aborts with 'Synchronization failure'
PTB-INFO: you can disable the sync test via call to Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 2); .
PTB-INFO: You won't get proper stimulus onset timestamps though, so windowed mode may be of limited use.
PTB-INFO: Failed to enable realtime-scheduling [Operation not permitted]!
PTB-INFO: You need to run Matlab or Octave with root-privileges, or run the script PsychLinuxConfiguration once for this to work.

PTB-INFO: VBL startline = 1800 , VBL Endline = 1851
PTB-INFO: Measured monitor refresh interval from beamposition = 16.669161 ms [59.991020 Hz].
PTB-INFO: Will use beamposition query for accurate Flip time stamping.
PTB-INFO: Measured monitor refresh interval from VBLsync = 16.668636 ms [59.992910 Hz]. (58 valid samples taken, stddev=0.684852 ms.)
PTB-INFO: Reported monitor refresh interval from operating system = 16.669723 ms [59.988998 Hz].
PTB-INFO: Small deviations between reported values are normal and no reason to worry.

WARNING: Couldn't compute a reliable estimate of monitor refresh interval! Trouble with VBL syncing?!?


----- ! PTB - ERROR: SYNCHRONIZATION FAILURE ! ----

One or more internal checks (see Warnings above) indicate that synchronization
of Psychtoolbox to the vertical retrace (VBL) is not working on your setup.

This will seriously impair proper stimulus presentation and stimulus presentation timing!
Please read 'help SyncTrouble' for information about how to solve or work-around the problem.
You can force Psychtoolbox to continue, despite the severe problems, by adding the command
Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1); at the top of your script, if you really know what you are doing.
